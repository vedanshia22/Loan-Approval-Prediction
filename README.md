# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval using a machine learning model developed in Python. The dataset comprises 13 features, and the goal is to accurately determine whether a loan application will be approved.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Boxplots and Heatmaps: Various plots were used to visualize the data and identify correlations between features.
2. Feature Correlation: Insights from the plots helped in understanding the relationships among different labels.

Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. K Neighbors Classifier

Key Features

1. Python Libraries: Utilized key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for model training and evaluation.
3. Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy to evaluate and compare model performance.
