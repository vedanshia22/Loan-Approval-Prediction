# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval using a machine learning model developed in Python. The dataset comprises 13 features, and the goal is to accurately determine whether a loan application will be approved.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Boxplots and Heatmaps: Various plots were used to visualize the data and identify correlations between features.
Feature Correlation: Insights from the plots helped in understanding the relationships among different labels.

Models Implemented

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
K Neighbors Classifier

Key Features

Python Libraries: Utilized key libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for model training and evaluation.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy to evaluate and compare model performance.
